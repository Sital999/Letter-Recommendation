    <h1>Letter of Recommendation</h1>
    <p>I would like to recommend <b>{{student.name}}</b> for admission to the graduate program at your university.
        His roll number is  <b>{{student.roll}}</b>
        I have known {{student.name}} for about {{years}} years now as an undergraduate student
        in <program> engineering. I have taught him courses on <courses_taught>. He is {{bani}}.
        {Moreover, I was the supervisor for his final year project.} </p>

    <p>I recall <name> as a sincere and hardworking student. 
        He maintained excellent academic performance throughout his undergraduate 
        ranking among the top 10% students of his batch. As an instructor and his supervisor
        too I had enough opportunity is observe his capabilities closely.</p>

    <p>I was the supervisor in his final year project titled “Road Accident News Information Extraction”. I was 
        quite impressed by his hardworking nature and learning capability. He developed an automated system 
        involving Name Entity Recognition, Semantic Role Labeling and Regular Expressions along with a news 
        site crawler. The NLP and information extraction techniques required a lot of literature study at his level. 
        I could observe his keen interest and aptitude for research while working on the project. In fact, at the end 
        of the project, he was also able to publish a paper in an international conference. </p>

    <p>I have seen that he is good in team work and also has good leadership capability. He is a well-spoken 
        person with a friendly and gentle personality. He is very helpful and cooperative student. He eagerly 
        handed over his project work to his juniors who wanted to further continue the research on the topic along 
        with proper guidance and resources. I have also seen his presentation and communication skills during his 
        project and paper presentations.</p>
    <p>I appreciate his technical and professional skills. Unlike, most students who limit their project to an 
        academic exercise, he actually deployed his project publicly in our server and also maintained it. After his 
        undergrad, he has worked as a developer in some IT companies which, I believe, has further added to his 
        technical skills and experience. Besides academics, he was also active in extra-curricular activities. He 
        organized a week-long hackathon during a technical festival of the campus and mentored the participants.
        </p>
    <p>I am quite confident that his skills coupled with academic capability will make him a good candidate for 
        your university. Thus, I would highly recommend him for the graduate program at your esteemed 
        university. Please feel free to contact me if further enquiry is required.</p>
